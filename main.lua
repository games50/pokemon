    Pokemon

    Few franchises have achieved the degree of fame as Pokemon, short for "Pocket Monsters",
    a Japanese monster-catching phenomenon that took the world by storm in the late 90s. Even
    to this day, Pokemon is hugely successful, with games, movies, and various other forms of
    merchandise selling like crazy. The game formula itself is an addicting take on the JRPG,
    where the player can not only fight random creatures in the wild but also recruit them to
    be in his or her party at all times, where they can level up, learn new abilities, and even
    evolve.

    This proof of concept demonstrates basic GUI usage, random encounters, creatures that the
    player can fight and catch with their own creatures, and basic NPC interaction in the form of
    very simple dialogue.
